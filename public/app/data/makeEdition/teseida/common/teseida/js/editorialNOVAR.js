{"type":"p", "text":"This digital edition fulfills the promise made on page xxvi of the 2015 printed edition: '[it] will provide a photograph of each page of the two manuscripts with a literal, facing page transcription of each page.' In addition, the digital edition provides for every one of the stanzas in Boccaccio's poem a word-by-word original spelling comparison of our edition and the transcriptions of the two manuscripts, with all substantive variants (as opposed to orthographic variants) marked. The digital edition also contains a search tool, offering keyword-in-context presentation of every occurrence of every word searched in the text. The search tool used is the StaticSearch system created by Martin Holmes and Joey Takeda for the <a href='https://endings.uvic.ca/'>Endings project</a>."},

{"type":"p", "text":"The idea for this digital edition arose when the editors took part in a two-week workshop at the Rockefeller Foundation Bellagio Centre in 2003, as part of a team collating seven manuscripts and two print editions of Dante's <hi rend='ital'>Commedia</hi>, now published online in Prue Shaw's <a href='https://www.dantecommedia.it/'>second edition</a>. The editors there met Peter Robinson, whose software and thinking about digital editions underlie this edition. Barbara Bordalejo devised the encoding system used in the digital transcriptions while Andrew West produced early prototypes of the digital edition. Francesca Galligan joined Peter, Barbara and ourselves in Pacentro for an intensive two-week period in 2005, in which we created the entire collation of the edition and two manuscripts underlying this digital edition. The editors express their thanks to all three, and particularly to Peter Robinson who, finally, brought this edition to the web. We also thank Lino Leonardi, our publisher of the print edition and co-publisher of the digital edition, for his help in making the images available and his unfailing support over many years."},

{"type":"p", "text":"The first Italian epic poem, the <i>Teseida</i> was written in response to Dante’s observation in the <i>De vulgari eloquentia</i> (2.2): while Cino da Pistoia had written Italian poetry about falling in love (<i>amoris accensio</i>) and Dante himself had made moral rectitude (<i>directio voluntatis</i>) the subject of his <i>Commedia</i>, a vernacular work on valor in arms (<i>armorum probitas</i>) had yet to be written. Boccaccio accepted Dante’s challenge and, in his envoy to the <i>Teseida</i> (<a href='../../../html/compare/12/84.html'>12.84</a>), expresses great hopes for his modern version of a classical epic. Contending that the <i>Teseida</i> represents the type of literary epic that Dante had described, Boccaccio characterizes his epic as the first to sing of the affairs of Mars «nel volgar lazio più mai non veduti» (12.84.8). The <i>Teseida</i>, he thus implies, is a vernacular work worthy of standing with the great achievements of Cino and of Dante."}, 

{"type":"p", "text":"The 9904-line poem, whose length approximates that of the <i>Aeneid</i>,<note type='ed'>Medieval copies of the Aeneid typically circulated in 9,896-line and in 9,900-line versions: the first version omitted the four lines that, according to Servius, served as a preface to Vergil’s epic while the second version included the four lines. Since Boccaccio’s 9,904-line poem exceeds both options, scholars can describe the <i>Teseida</i> autograph as only approximating Vergil; however, Boccaccio omitted eight lines in the second, beta, version of the <i>Teseida</i> represented by NO, the Biblioteca Oratoriana manuscript. He thus created a 9,896-line poem that, depending on his understanding of the length of Vergil’s epic, would either have expressed Boccaccio’s confident belief that his <i>Teseida</i> equaled Vergil’s achievement or would have served as a self-effacing statement that his modern vernacular epic could not quite equal its classical antecedent. Lacking information about Boccaccio’s copy of the Aeneid, however, we still remain uncertain about Boccaccio’s judgment of the <i>Teseida</i> in relation to the Aeneid. See Anderson, Before the Knight’s Tale, 142, and Coleman, Oratoriana <i>Teseida</i>, 119-20</note> is, like Vergil’s epic, divided into 12 books. Acknowledging the poetry of his own age, Boccaccio uses 15 sonnets, in a variety of formats, to introduce the poem and its 12 books and to conclude the poem.<note type='ed'>The poem contains twelve 14-line, one 15-line, and two 16-line sonnets:<br/>14-line sonnet (two types):<br/>(a) the <i>sonneto generale</i> to the poem as a whole plus the specific introducdtory sonnet (<i>argomento particulare</i>) to bks. 2-8 and 11; the sonnet format, used by Giacomo da Lentini, is a two-quatrain octet (a-b-a-b; a-b-a-b) plus a sestet (c-d-c-d-c-d);<br/>(b) the introductory (argomento particulare) sonnet to bks. 1, 9, 10; the sonnet format, used by Petrarch, is a two-quatrain octet (a-b-b-a; a-b-b-a) plus a sestet (c-d-c-d-c-d).<br/>15-line sonnet: the introductory sonnet (<i>argomento particulare</i>) to bk. 12; the sonnet format, a variant of the Petrarchan sonnet, is a two-quatrain octet (a-b-b-a; a-b-b-a) and a two-part septet ending with a couplet (c-d-c-d-c; d-d). <br/>16-line sonnet: two 16-line concluding sonnets: (1) <i>l’autore priegha le Muse</i> and (2) Risposta delle Muse. The sonnet format, a variant of the Petrarchan sonnet, is a two-quatrain octet (a-b-b-a; a-b-b-a) plus a three-part octet ending with a couplet (c-d-e; e-d-c; f-f ).</note> Some 1,300 glosses – from one word to more than 5,000 words in length – appear in the margins or between the lines of the poem.<note type='ed'>The gloss on the Temple of Venus (7.50.1) has 5,069 words; the next longest gloss, on the Temple of Mars (7.30.1) contains 1,331 words.</note>"},

{"type":"p", "text":"The <i>Teseida</i> consists of a prose introduction in which the author states that the purpose of his poem is to win back the affection of an idealized woman whom he calls Fiammetta. Written in <i>ottava rima</i>, the form that also served Boccaccio in the <i>Filostrato</i> and the <i>Ninfale Fiesolano</i>, the 12-book poem narrates two related tales of love and conflict: the Athenian siege of the Amazon capital, concluding with Theseus and his men marrying the Amazon women, and the conflict between the two cousins, Palemone and Arcita, for the love of Emilia, concluding with her marriage to Arcita and, after his death, to Palemone. In each instance, the wise and model ruler, Teseo, duke of Athens, uses married love as a means to re-establish peace and to restore order. Two sonnets conclude the poem: the first asks the Muses’ blessing on the poem, requesting that they consult with his beloved lady about supplying its name; the second is the Muses’ reply, which quotes Fiammetta’s response to the poem – «Hay, quante d’amor forze in costor foro!» – and then provides the name that she and the Muses have given the poem: <i>Theseyda di nozze d’Emilia</i>."}

{"title":"The present edition", "key":"Edition", "text":[
{"type":"p", "text":"The present critical edition is based on the autograph of the <i>Teseida</i> in the Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana, Florence, that was copied by Boccaccio c. 1348-1350 and revised by the author during the following decade. Although <i>Aut</i> finally provided a reliable, authoritative copy of the <i>Teseida</i>, the manuscript presents editors with a variety of challenges: it has suffered water-spotting, text lost when the manuscript was trimmed during a later rebinding, the loss of a folio containing 80 lines of poetry plus an uncertain number of glosses,<note type='ed'>See Appendix 6: <i>Lost Folio</i>. Because of the loss of fol. 137a, it is not possible to specify the exact number of glosses in <i>Aut</i>. In its present state, the autograph has 1307 glosses, eight of which (4.49.8, 5.24.7, 7.79.4, 8.81.6, 8.87.5, 8.102.8, 11.77.1, and 12.5.4) are probably not by Boccaccio.</note> and over-tracing by a later scribe (C3) with an inelegant hand and an often inaccurate eye.<note type='ed'>The most serious over-tracing by hand C3 occurs in the first ten quires of <i>Aut</i> at fols. 1r, 1v, 2r, 3r, 3v, 4r, 6v, 9r, 10r, 10v, 13v, 17r, 17v, 20r, 22r, 29v, 30r, 31r, 33v, 34r, 34v, 36r, 40v, 45r, 46v, 61v, 52r, 53v, 54r, 56v, 57r, 61v, 62r, 67r, 72v, 73r-77v, and 78v.</note>"

{"title":"A text in progress", "key":"TextInProgress", "text":[
{"type":"p", "text":"Most editions aspire to present a version of a text that represents the author’s ultimate intentions concerning the work. The scholarship on Boccaccio’s works, however, continues to provide evidence that the poet was continually concerned with re-casting, re-writing, and re-composing his works. For such writers, the prospect of a final edition expressing an author’s ultimate intentions is impossible. Since this seems to be the case with Boccaccio, the present edition will serve to remind readers and scholars that an edition of the “ultimate” <i>Teseida</i>, the “final intention” <i>Teseida</i>, is not possible and, perhaps, not desirable."},

{"type":"p", "text":"This edition of the <i>Teseida</i> represents Boccaccio’s epic during the decade of the 1350s, which began with his copying <i>Aut</i>, text and glosses. The process continued through a series of revisions and additions by Boccaccio that occurred during the rest of the decade and beyond. Instead of considering <i>Aut</i> as a final product, we would argue that it reveals a process: the development of the <i>Teseida</i> from the late 1340s to c. 1360. That process, of course, continued."},

{"type":"p", "text":"As NO demonstrates, after first composing, then embellishing and revising the alpha form of the <i>Teseida</i>, Boccaccio’s interests subsequently seem to have changed in the direction of a beta form of the epic. For scholars interested in the beta form of the <i>Teseida</i> represented by NO, we have included appendices comparing the drawings/drawing spaces, the parafs, and the glosses in both man- uscripts and indicating the substantial variants in the poem and glosses of each.This information is presented in the six appendices to the edition, which will permit readers to evaluate the evolution of the <i>Teseida</i> after the composition of the Laurentian Library autograph."},

{"type":"p", "text":"<i>Aut</i> represents a point in Boccaccio’s continued involvement with the <i>Teseida</i> and it provides us with a very clear understanding of the master’s continuing revisions of the text. Despite its occasional flaws, <i>Aut</i> is the best surviving copy of his epic. For these reasons and, only barring the highly unlikely discovery of a more perfect autograph, it remains the pre-eminent witness to the poet’s intentions and to his working habits."}]},

{"title":"Editorial criteria", "key":"EditorialCriteria", "text":[
{"type":"p", "text":"Salvatore Battaglia’s edition of Boccaccio’s <i>Teseida</i> (Accademia della Crusca, 1938) was based largely on the editorial principles that Michele Barbi had adopted for his Società Dantesca edition of Dante’s <i>Vita Nuova</i> (1932). Battaglia’s edition established an editorial standard that was largely followed in the two subsequent, widely circulated critical editions of the <i>Teseida</i> by Aurelio Roncaglia (1941) and Alberto Limentani (1964). A fundamental quality shared by these three 20th century editions is that, with minimal differences, they normalized the spelling of the autograph to modern usage."},

{"type":"p", "text":"The present edition of the <i>Teseida</i> takes a different position.The edition strives to preserve the characteristics of Boccaccio’s scripta that reflect the author’s natural phonetics (i.e. Tuscanisms) and his literary culture (i.e. Latinisms) without reproducing the elements and qualities that can be attributed to mere spelling differences. Our work toward this goal has benefitted from the model provided by Gianfranco Contini’s edition of Petrarch’s autograph of the <i>Rerum vulgarium fragmenta</i> (1949; 1964). The edition is particularly useful since the Petrarch and the Boccaccio autographs, which were composed at approximately the same time, present similar editorial questions and challenges."}, 

{"type":"p", "text":"Like the <i>Rerum vulgarium autograph</i>, <i>Aut</i> continued to accumulate added and revised text for several years after its original composition. Besides revising many of the readings in the poem, Boccaccio added another 220 glosses to the c. 1100 glosses in the original copying of the manuscript. In addition to Boccaccio’s revisions and additions, <i>Aut</i> contains many examples of over-traced text, particularly in the marginal glosses.The over-tracing was the work of a later, often unreliable hand, C3. As a result, a number of misreadings, particularly those in the glosses, appear in the modern editions of the <i>Teseida</i>."},

{"type":"p", "text":"Where a faded and over-traced reading is illegible, we have used the <i>Mondo Nuovo</i> infra-red /ultra-violet apparatus in an attempt to recapture Boccaccio’s original text. Although this process has been generally successful, some readings are uncertain, while others cannot be deciphered. In such cases, we have consulted NO, the 15th century copy of Boccaccio’s beta version of the <i>Teseida</i>. (In each instance the source of the reading is indicated in the textual notes to the edition.)"},

{"type":"p", "text":"Several other examples can be seen in <i>Aut</i> where Boccaccio has revised, corrected, or added to the text of <i>Aut</i>. In such cases, we have adopted Boccaccio’s latest reading for the final version of the edition and have noted the earlier reading in the textual apparatus. In those instances where Boccaccio-scribe unmistakebly makes a copying error, this is emended and noted in the apparatus."},

{"type":"p", "text":"Therefore, text has been emended where (1) Boccaccio’s hand is not legible, even under ultra-violet light, (2) NO and the short-commentary manuscripts agree against the reading in the hand C3, and (3) the text is inconsistent with Boccaccio’s usage."},

{"type":"p", "text":"Concerning rhymes, some anomalous rhymed endings are normalized. e.g.:<br/><i>intendieno = intendeano : temeano</i> 1.78.7/8<br/><i>combattieno = combatteano: voleano : faceano</i> 5.82.2/4/6<br/> <i>ameno : ripieno : surgeano = surgeno</i> 7.51.2/4/6<br/><i>vedeansi = vediensi : rodiensi : sentiensi</i> 7.97.1/3/5"}]},

{"title":"The manuscripts", "key":"Manuscripts", "text":[
{"type":"p", "text":"Giorgio Padoan has provided a memorable description of Boccaccio’s method of composition: he created neither a single original copy from which the manuscript tradition of the work mechanically descends, nor several distinct originals, from which the variant versions of his works descend. Rather, he composed a series of related autographs – «un ventaglio di autografi» – gathered around the stem of one or more versions. As a result, we have two forms of the <i>Genealogia deorum gentilium</i> and the <i>De casibus virorum illustrium</i>, three redactions of the <i>Trattatello in Laude di Dante</i>, and (as a kind of testament of Boccaccio’s self-editing) <i>De mulieribus claris</i> in seven or perhaps nine versions. In addition, this habit of composition was a life-long process: as Vittore Branca’s edition of <i>Il Decameron</i> (1976) demonstrates, Boccaccio continued revising his prose masterpiece even in the last years of his life."},

{"type":"p", "text":"The 68 presently known manuscripts of Boccaccio’s <i>Teseida</i> suggest that he followed a similar process in producing his epic. The <i>Teseida</i> appears to have been created in three versions, the first beginning in the 1340s, the period when Boccaccio is assumed to have originally composed the <i>Teseida</i>. The second version would be Boccaccio’s production of the <i>Teseida</i> autograph (<i>Aut</i>) in the late-1340s or c.1350, while the third version would be a beta autograph (NO1) most likely copied in the mid-1350s or later, that survives in a manuscript copy produced in mid-15th century Florence. While the second and third versions are clearly and closely related to each other, the first version is vexingly difficult to describe precisely because it represents the complex type of evolution that Padoan described. See the print introduction for detailed discussion of the manuscripts and their groupings."}
